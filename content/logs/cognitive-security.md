Started exploring how cognitive overload leads to security failures. Alert fatigue, decision fatigue, automation bias—these are attack surfaces. The human operator is often the weakest link, not because they're careless, but because systems are designed without considering cognitive limits.

CogSec project: use Gemini to model these cognitive vulnerabilities and recommend human-centered mitigations.

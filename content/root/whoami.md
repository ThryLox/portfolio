I am a security-focused systems architect and developer, dedicated to building reliable, minimal, and secure infrastructures. 

My work bridges the gap between offensive security and defensive architecture, ensuring that systems are not only functional but resilient by design.

Currently exploring the intersection of AI safety, cloud security, and distributed systems.

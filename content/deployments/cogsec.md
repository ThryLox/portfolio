# Overview

**CogSec** shifts cybersecurity from system-centric to human-centric analysis. Using **Gemini 3 Pro**, it reconstructs and analyzes security failures caused by cognitive pressure, bias, and decision fatigue.

The system treats the human operator as the primary vulnerability vector—not the missing patch.

## How It Works

1. **Telemetry Capture** — Sandbox collects response times, click patterns, and cognitive load indicators
2. **Vulnerability Inference** — Maps behaviors to cognitive biases (automation bias, time pressure heuristics)
3. **Counterfactual Reasoning** — Calculates "what if" risk deltas under modified conditions
4. **Human-Centered Mitigations** — Recommends design changes, not just technical fixes

---

## Key Innovation

Traditional security focuses on technical controls. CogSec asks: *"What cognitive state led to this failure?"*

Outputs include forensic timelines, vulnerability mappings, and actionable interventions targeting alert fatigue, habituation, and decision overload.

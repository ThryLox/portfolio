Built Driftlite to detect when ML models start behaving differently in production. PSI and KS-Test are simple but effective—no complex monitoring infrastructure needed.

Key finding: drift correlates with accuracy degradation, but the relationship isn't linear. Early detection window matters more than precision of the signal.

**Observation:** system latency mirrors **cognitive latency** — both are thresholds between input and action.
When monitoring endpoint agents, I realized that identity in computation is built from state persistence and I/O feedback loops — not static variables.

### Reflection
Perhaps the self, too, is a **daemon**, running indefinitely under a scheduler we call attention.
Stopping it gracefully without a kernel panic — that’s enlightenment.

Explored **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** for multi-tenant compliance enforcement.
Integrated PowerShell reporting modules into OPA’s JSON-based evaluation pipeline.

### Result
Dynamic rule checking for federal directives (ITSB-33) with auditable logs.

The policy-as-code model proved scalable and transparent — no more static configuration headaches.
Next: containerize the evaluator and expose REST endpoints for real-time checks.

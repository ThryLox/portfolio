Led data migration from STS to Tripleseat for Conference Services. Key lessons:

1. Data cleaning takes 3x longer than expected
2. Vendor import templates are never as flexible as documented
3. Institutional knowledge is irreplaceable for validation
4. Always export before you transform

40+ hours of schema mapping, validation, and cleanup. Worth it for clean operational data.
